# RecipeHub

Welcome to RecipeHub, my family's culinary legacy! This project is a tribute to one of the most cherished treasures in my family: Food. Since my childhood, I've been surrounded by delightful aromas and flavors passed down through generations. My grandmother shared her culinary secrets, my mother passed on her traditional recipes, and as I grew up, I realized that food is not just sustenance; it's a way to preserve our culture and roots.

On my recipe page, you'll discover a carefully curated selection of dishes that have graced our family celebrations for decades. Each recipe is infused with stories, shared moments around the table, and the passion I've invested in perfecting them over time. My goal is to share the joy and connection that food can bring to our lives.

## Project Overview

RecipeHub is a web application built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It utilizes [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load the Inter font, a custom Google Font.

To get started with RecipeHub, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using your preferred package manager:

   ```bash

   # or
   yarn install
   # or

   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your own credentials as needed.

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
